This is a paper template built in LaTeX. It contains a preamble with several LaTeX packages, with an addition of Stata's estwide commands, which allows one to input Stata's 
automated generated tables (using esttab commands) into LaTeX with beautiful formatting. This template also features BibLaTeX references. In order to put it into work,
insert all files into your LaTeX workspace (if you use Overleaf, download all files in the overleaf's workspace at the left portion of the page), and use main.tex as your main file. All other folders are called inside main.tex.
